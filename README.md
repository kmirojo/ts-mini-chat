### TypeScript socket.io config

- The socket.io configuration is not the same with TypeScript as with JavaScript. To have a clear configuration it's better to read the [documentation related to Socket.io + Typescript](https://socket.io/docs/v3/migrating-from-2-x-to-3-0/#The-Socket-IO-codebase-has-been-rewritten-to-TypeScript).
